# TY_279_Assignment_6
Follow the screenshots I gave in the week6 notes and create a repository, give a name, keep it as Public, open it click on edit and answer the following questions there. and send me the link in word document and upload it.

**1. what is Distributed version control system and explain the advantages of it.**

  Distributed version control system (DVCS) takes a complete repository and brings a copy to every team member's computer and allows for committing, branchingm and merging locally. This allows the server to free up space as it does not need to store a physical file for each branch. It only needs the differences between each commit. DVCS are usefully for software development because it creates strong hierarchies and workflows. How this happens is that each developer has their own respository and changes that code, so that code can go through a review process and then merged to the main repository so ensure quality code. 

  The advantages of using a distributed version control system (DVCS) is that it creates a culture of collaboration and leverages of modern version control tools capabilities, while the organization can ensure their position at the forefront of software development innovation. Some of the key advantages are reliable backup copies, fast merging and flexible branching, rapid feedback and fewer merge conflicts, and flexibility to work offline.

  First, it has reliable backup copies. This happens because you basically create an offsite backup everytime you clone the repository, so every team member's copy is a backup. This is beneficial the distributed version removes the reliance on a single backup in a centralized version.

  Second, it is fast merging and has flexible branching. This is because you do not need remote server communications; making merging code quick and easy. DVCS allows for the team to use different branching strategies. This can not be done in a centralized system. DVCS helps to get deliverables out causing business value to increase as the team members can be more innovatived rather than getting backed up with slow builds.

  Third, it has rapid feedback and fewer merge conflicts. DVCS makes branching easy. This happens as a result of having the entire repository's history on their local computers, so they can experiment and do code reviews. In turn this makes getting feedback easier and faster as they do not need to merge the changeset first. Also, this causes there to be less merge conflicts as the contributors can focus on their own code.

  Fourth, it has the flexibility to work offline. DVSC does not need internet connection to work, the only thing you lose is the ability to push and pull. This allows for you to work from anywhere like on a beach. Each contributor has their own running history on their hard drive, so their own repository gets updated. This increases developer productivity as team members can fix bugs on their own. 
  
**2. What is the key Git terms?**

   There are 6 key Git terms. First, is repository or repo and it is a project folder that Git tracks. Second, is commit and is a snapchat of your changes. Third, is branch and it is a parallel version of your project to test new features. Fourth, is merge and is used to combined changes from different branches. Fifth is clone and it downloads a Git repository to your own local computer. Lastly, is push/pull and means that send is push and fetch is pull. They are used to change to/from remote repository.
